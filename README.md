This method of implementation includes the layer class that is being inherited to all other classes and different activations class take allow the layers to take different activations. 

In this methodology each layer is considered separately. Forward and backward propagation of each layer is done within the epoch loop for predictions. 

The methodology uses classes, inheritance, mulilevel inheritance, polymorphism, static methods, functions etc.
